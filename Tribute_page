            <p>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, (born October 15, 1931,
                Rameswaram, India—died July 27, 2015, Shillong), Indian scientist and politician who played a
                eading role in the development of India’s missile and nuclear weapons programs. He was
                president of India from 2002 to 2007.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam is one of India’s most celebrated scientists and statesmen and was 
                President of the Republic of India from 2002 through 2007. An aeronautical engineer by 
                training, he significantly advanced rocketry in India’s Defense Research and Development 
                Organization (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). Heir to the vision of 
                Professor Vikram Sarabhai, who set India on a course of a socio-economically oriented space 
                program, Dr. Kalam was the man who raised India’s eyes to the stars, and raised India to join 
                the community of spacefaring nations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dr. Kalam was regarded as one of the greatest minds, visionaries, and peacemakers of the early 
                21st century. His integrity and deep belief in everything he did registered strongly with the 
                Indian people. Kalam was voted one of India’s two most trusted men during a period in which 
                India deeply distrusted its politicians. He has received many honorary degrees and other honors,
                including India’s highest civilian award, Bharat Ratna. He is the author of many books, including 
                an autobiography Wings of Fire.
